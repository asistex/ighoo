## Pull Requests

Your pull requests are welcome; however, they may not be accepted for various reasons.
Read [**`pull_request_template.md`**](https://github.com/asistex/ighoo/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md) for a few guidelines listed will help speed up the process of getting them fixed.
All Pull Requests, except for translations and user documentation, need to be attached to a issue on GitHub. For Pull Requests regarding enhancements and questions, the issue must first be approved by one of project's administrators before being merged into the project. An approved issue will have the label **`Accepted`**. For issues that have not been accepted, you may request to be assigned to that issue.

Opening a issue beforehand allows the administrators and the community to discuss bugs and enhancements before work begins, preventing wasted effort.


### Guidelines for pull requests

1. Respect HMG Harbour coding style.
2. Create a new branch for each PR. **`Make sure your branch name wasn't used before`** - you can add date (for example `patch3_20200528`) to ensure its uniqueness.
3. Single feature or bug-fix per PR.
4. Make single commit per PR.
5. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.

In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request will get accepted.
